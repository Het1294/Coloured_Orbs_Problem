Problem Statement

Chef has discovered three types of magical orbs: Red, Blue, and Green. Initially, he owns a certain number of Red orbs (R) and Blue orbs (B), while the number of Green orbs is zero. These orbs are special because they can increase Chefâ€™s skill level. However, Chef can also perform a unique conversion to transform his orbs.

The rules of the game are as follows:

Conversion Rule:

Chef can obtain 1 Green orb by exchanging 1 Red orb and 1 Blue orb together.

This conversion can be repeated as long as Chef has both Red and Blue orbs available.

Skill Contribution:

Each Red orb contributes +1 skill point.

Each Blue orb contributes +2 skill points.

Each Green orb contributes +5 skill points.

Initial Skill:

Chef starts with a skill level of 0.

The objective is to determine the maximum skill level Chef can achieve after optimally converting some of his Red and Blue orbs into Green orbs.
